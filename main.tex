\section{Chapter 3: The Church-Turing Thesis}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Explain how decision problems can be formalized by the notion of language of finite words. Develop an example of a language that formalizes a problem}

\item \textbf{Define the notion of configuration of a Turing machine. Define the notion of computation of a deterministic Turing machine M on a word $w$.}

A \emph{configuration} of a TM consists of three items --- the current state, tape contents and head location. For a state $q$ and two strings $u$ and $v$ over the tape alphabet $\Gamma$ we could write a configuration $uqv$ where : $uv$ is the current content of the tape, $q$ is the current state and the head location is the first symbol of $v$.\\

$1011q_701111$ represents a configuration when the tape is $101101111$, the current state is $q_7$ and the head is on the second $0$ (given by the position of $q_7$ in $1011q_701111$.)
