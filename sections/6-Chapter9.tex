\subsection{Define the notion of space constructible function $f \text{ : } \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. Give an example of such a function and explain why it is so}

\subsection{Knowing that the equivalence between extended regular expressions is ExpSpace-Complete, show by applying the space hierarchy theorem that this problem can not be solved in deterministic polynomial time, nor in nondeterministic polynomial time}

\subsection{Define the notion of Turing machine with oracle. Define the set of lan guages that can be solved in $\text{P}^\text{SAT}$ , define a language that belongs to this set and which is not believed to be in NP (explain why)}

\subsection{What do we know about the relations between the complexity classes P, NP, PSPACE, EXPTIME, and EXPSPACE? Explain}
