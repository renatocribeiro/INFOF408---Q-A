\subsection{Define the notion of space complexity. Illustrate the difference between time complexity and space complexity by showing an example of problem that can be solved in $O(t(n))$ space but we believe cannot be solved in $O(t(n))$ time}

\subsection{If a language $L \in \text{SPACE}(O(t(n))$ with $t(n) \geq n$, what can we say about}
the time complexity of $L$

\subsection{State and prove Savitchâ€™s theorem}

\subsection{Define the classes PSPACE, NPSPACE, coPSPACE and coNPSPACE. Explain why all those classes are equal}

\subsection{Define the notion of PSPACE-Completness and give two examples of problems that are PSPACE-Complete}

\subsection{Explain why TQBF can be solved in polynomial space}

\subsection{Give the main arguments and constructions underlying the proof that TQBF is PSPACE-Complete. Explain why the proof of Cook-Levin theorem cannot be applied directly to show that TQBF is PSPACE-Complete}

\subsection{Prove that Generalized Geography is PSPACE-Complete}

\subsection{Define the class L and NL. In those definitions we use Turing machines with a read only input tape and read/write working tape, explain why}

\subsection{Explain why PATH is in NL, and why we believe that it is not in L}

\subsection{Explain how we can bound the time complexity of a Turing machine which decides a language in L}
